# Mailbox Service
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Mailbox Service fetches and process mails from IMAP server. For example, if
# the service fetches an email to a project, it posts the email as an issue of
# the project.
#
# If you want to use this feature, your IMAP server has to be configured to
# support the address alias using '+' sign, also known as 'subaddressing' or
# 'detailed addressing'. For example, emails to 'yobi+issue@yourmail.com' have
# to be delivered to 'yobi@yourmail.com'.
#
# SECURITY WARNING: Yobi believes the email address in From header of the
# received email is truthful and use it for authentication without doubt. To
# avoid this problem, your imap server must deny every email whose From header
# is forged.
#
# Here is an example if you use Gmail.
#
# Set imap.use to true if you want to use this feature.
imap.use = false
imap.host = imap.googlemail.com
