Yobi v0.8.0 Release Notes
=========================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

If you are upgrading from any previous version, You may need to update
conf/application.conf for backward compatibility.

### Use explicit path to database

If you are using implicit relative path for the db.default.url,
then you have to change it to use explicit relative path like:

    AS IS:
    db.default.url="jdbc:h2:file:yobi;MODE=PostgreSQL"

    TO BE:
    db.default.url="jdbc:h2:file:./yobi;MODE=PostgreSQL"

### Specify country code

Since Yobi 0.8.0, language codes are changed to include country code to fix the
bug that i18n does not work for some browsers. So you have to country code
after every language code as follows:

    application.langs="en-US, ko-KR, ja-JP"

Updates since v0.7.2
------------------

* Updated H2 database to v1.4.184. (45e1288)
