# Using issues

Many tasks exist when projects are ongoing. For managing and tracing these tasks, Yobi provides you a solution, `Issues`.

You can share problems and tasks with project members by creating issues and assign issues to them. You can also manage schedule by using `Milestone`.


Creating new issues
-------------------

1. Go to a project in which you want to make an issue.
1. Click the `New issue` button.
1. Fill out the forms and then click the `Save` button.

### Assignee

You can choose an assignee on the issue.

1. Click the `Assignee` drop down box on the right of the the issue page.
1. You will see project members.

To assign an issue to an member means that the member should solve the issue. 

Issues are filtered by project member names on `Issues` page.

### Milestones
